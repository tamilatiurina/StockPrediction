AI-powered stock prediction platform
Design a database for an AI-powered stock prediction platform. We need to store information about users, portfolios, stocks, market news, watchlists, AI model results, and performance metrics. Each user must have a unique username, email, and password, and users can have several watchlists and portfolios. User should be able to follow each other. Users may also provide ratings on the AI model’s predictions. Each stock available for trading must have detailed information including the stock’s ticker, name and its sector, which must be categorized into primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary sectors. The stock must also be linked to an industry classification. Market news relevant to each stock must be stored, with each news article having a date, headline, and content. Additionally, each news article should undergo sentiment analysis, generating a sentiment score (positive, negative, or neutral) to assess the news' impact on the stock's value. Users can create portfolios, and within each portfolio, they can hold various stocks. For each stock in the portfolio we need to store the quantity owned, the purchase date, and the purchase price (and sell date, sell price if present). Users can hold the same stock in different portfolios. Watchlists will allow users to track stocks they are interested in, but not necessarily owning. Each watchlist should be associated with a user, and users can have multiple watchlists, each containing multiple stocks. We also need to store AI model predictions for each stock, including prediction type (whether the price is expected to go up or down etc.), the predicted value, confidence level, recommended action (buy, sell, hold), and the date of the prediction. We also should be able to track the performance of these AI models using performance metrics. This will include the accuracy rate of the model over time to provide users with an understanding of how reliable the predictions are. We should track how predictions evolve over time and how feedback from users affects the future accuracy of the model.
